# JavaVsCode

The Java demonstration projects were created using Visual Studio Code 1.45.0 and Java Development Kit 14.0.1.7.

## Demonstration
Program execution occurs solely in Visual Studio Code using Java extensions.  Run the server.  Run a client.  Run another client.  

To run the server, simply right-click the Server.java file and select run.  

To run the first client, simply right-click Client.java file and select run.

To run the second client, simply right-click Client.java file and select run.

Cycle between the two clients using the Terminal shell drop-down that allows you to select either 2: Java Process Console or 3: Java Process Console.

The animated gif below shows program execution.
